   @title Some Erlang Language examples
   @doc 'language' is a "my first erlang" application that illustrates several of the basic language features, each in their own module.
   The application has been written as an erlang 'language' application - in that language.erl doesn't do anything and language.app.src has no 'module' 
   tuplet. 
   
   The app is built using rebar and the langauge.app.src reflects this.
